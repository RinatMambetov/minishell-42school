# minishell-42school (my grade is 125/100)
This project is about creating a simple shell.<br><br>
Yes, your own little bash.<br><br>
You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.<br><br>
The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.<br><br>
At the time, all developers agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned
1/0 switches was seriously irritating.<br><br>
It was only logical that they came up with the idea of creating a software to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to the human language.<br><br>
Thanks to Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems
people faced when Windows didn’t exist.<br><br>
